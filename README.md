I've been really interested in the CA governor's proposal to [Streamline Local Housing Approvals](http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3470). The proposal stipulates that:

> A project must set 20 percent of its housing units at prices affordable to low-income households for at least 30 years. These requirements would be lower for projects within one-half mile of an existing or planned transit stop. In these cases, developers would need to set aside either (1) 10 percent of the housing for low-income households or (2) 5 percent for very-low-income households.

#### What is "within one-half mile of an existing or planned transit stop"?
