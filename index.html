    I've been really interested in the CA governor's proposal to
    <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3470">Streamline Local Housing Approvals</a>.
    The proposal stipulates that:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      A project must set 20 percent of its housing units at prices affordable to
      low-income households for at least 30 years. These requirements would be lower
      for projects within one-half mile of an existing or planned transit stop. In
      these cases, developers would need to set aside either (1) 10 percent of the
      housing for low-income households or (2) 5 percent for very-low-income households.
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    So, what is "within one-half mile of an existing or planned transit stop"? The
    map below has a half-mile circle for every transit stop for BART, AC Transit,
    Caltrain, SFMTA, SamTrans, and VTA.
